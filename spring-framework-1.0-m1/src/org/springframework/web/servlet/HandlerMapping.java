/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that define a mapping between
 * requests and handler objects.
 *
 * <p>This class can be implemented by application developers, although this
 * is not necessary, as BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping and SimpleUrlHandlerMapping
 * are included in the framework. The former is the default if no
 * HandlerMapping bean is registered in the application context.
 *
 * <p>HandlerMapping implementations can support mapped interceptors but do
 * not have to. A handler will always be wrapped in a HandlerExecutionChain
 * instance, optionally accompanied by some HandlerInterceptor instances.
 * The DispatcherServlet will first call each HandlerInterceptor's preHandle
 * method in the given order, finally invoking the handler itself if all
 * preHandle method have returned "true".
 *
 * <p>The ability to parameterize this mapping is a powerful and unusual
 * capability of this MVC framework. For example, it is possible to write
 * a custom mapping based on session state, cookie state or many other
 * variables. No other MVC framework seems to be equally flexible.
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations can implement the Ordered interface to be able
 * to specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting applied by
 * DispatcherServlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.
