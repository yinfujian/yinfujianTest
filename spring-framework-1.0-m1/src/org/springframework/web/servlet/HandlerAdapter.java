/**
 * MVC framework SPI interface, allowing parameterization of core MVC workflow.
 *
 * <p>Interface that must be implemented for each handler type to handle a request.
 * This interface is used to allow the DispatcherServlet to be indefinitely
 * extensible. The DispatcherServlet accesses all installed handlers through this
 * interface, meaning that it does not contain code specific to any handler type.
 *
 * <p>Note that a handler can be of type Object. This is to enable handlers from
 * other frameworks to be integrated with this framework without custom coding.
 *
 * <p>This interface is not intended for application developers. It is available
 * to handlers who want to develop their own web workflow.
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations can implement the Ordered interface to be able to
 * specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting applied by
 * DispatcherServlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.
