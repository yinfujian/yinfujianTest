/**
 * Simple implementation of ViewResolver that interprets a view name
 * as bean name in the current application context, i.e. in the XML
 * file of the executing DispatcherServlet.
 *
 * <p>This resolver can be handy for small applications, keeping all
 * definitions ranging from controllers to views are in the same place.
 * For normal applications, XmlViewResolver will be the better choice,
 * as it separates the XML bean definitions in a dedicated views file.
 * View beans should virtually never have references to any other
 * application beans - such a separation will make this clear.
 *
 * <p>This ViewResolver does not support internationalization.
 * Consider ResourceBundleViewResolver if you need to apply
 * different view resources per locale.
