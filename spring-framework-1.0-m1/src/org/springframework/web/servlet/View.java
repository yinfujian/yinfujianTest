/**
 * MVC View for a web interaction. Implementations are responsible
 * for rendering content, and exposing models. Multiple models can
 * be exposed by a single view.
 *
 * <p>This class and the MVC approach associated with it is discussed in Chapter 12 of
 * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1861007841/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development</a>
 * by Rod Johnson (Wrox, 2002).
 *
 * <p>View implementations may differ widely. An obvious implementation
 * would be JSP-based. Other implementations might be XSLT based, or use
 * an HTML generation library. This interface is designed to avoid
 * restricting the range of possible implementations.
 *
 * <p>Views should be beans. They are likely to be instantiated as beans
 * by a ViewResolver.
 *
 * <p>This interface is stateless. View implementations should be threadsafe.
