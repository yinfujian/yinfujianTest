/**
 * Extension of BeanFactory to be implemented by bean factories that can
 * enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients.
 *
 * <p>If this is a HierarchicalBeanFactory, the return values will not take any
 * BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans defined
 * in the current factory. Use the BeanFactoryUtils helper class to get all.
 * 
 * <p>With the exception of getBeanDefinitionCount(), the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
 *
 * <p>BeanFactory implementations that preload all their beans (for example,
 * DOM-based XML factories) may implement this interface.
 *
 * <p>This interface is discussed in "Expert One-on-One J2EE", by Rod Johnson.
