/**
 * Convenient superclass for stateless session beans (SLSBs), minimizing
 * the work involved in implementing an SLSB and preventing common errors.
 * <b>Note that SLSBs are the most useful kind of EJB.</b>
 *
 * <p>As the ejbActivate() and ejbPassivate() methods cannot be invoked
 * on SLSBs, these methods are implemented to throw an exception and should
 * not be overriden by subclasses. (Unfortunately the EJB specification
 * forbids enforcing this by making EJB lifecycle methods final.)
 *
 * <p>There should be no need to override the setSessionContext() or
 * ejbCreate() lifecycle methods.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses are left to implement the onEjbCreate() method to do
 * whatever initialization they wish to do after their BeanFactory has
 * already been loaded, and is available from the getBeanFactory() method.
 *
 * <p>This class provides the no-argument ejbCreate() method required
 * by the EJB specification, but not the SessionBean interface,
 * eliminating a common cause of EJB deployment failure.
