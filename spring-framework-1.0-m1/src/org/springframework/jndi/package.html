The classes in this package make JNDI easier to use,
facilitating the accessing of configuration stored in JNDI,
and provide useful superclasses for JNDI access classes.

<p>In particular, application classes using this package do not
need to catch naming exceptions or obtain JNDI contexts.

<p>The classes in this package are discussed in Chapter 11 of
